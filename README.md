## Description
The motivation of doing this assignment was for me to really dig down in the code and find ways to refactor it and make the code more semantically tuned.I wanted to get a better understanding on how to consolidate code as well as use proper semantic tags to make the code more readable and intuitive This refactored code solved a few problems with how the original code was not easy readable and had much repetitive css code. With my reactored code its much more clear and concise and easier to read. I learned a lot how to properly use specific tags throughout an HTML file. For example nav, section, main, footer and header. I also learned a lot on how to reference CSS properly.
